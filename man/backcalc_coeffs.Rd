\arguments{
\item{b}{Numeric. Unstandardized regression coefficient.}

\item{se}{Numeric. Standard error of the unstandardized coefficient.}

\item{std_beta}{Numeric. Standardized regression coefficient.}

\item{se_std}{Numeric. Standard error of the standardized coefficient.}

\item{sd_x, sd_y}{Numeric. Standard deviations of the predictor and outcome variables. Used to convert between standardized and unstandardized forms.}

\item{df}{Numeric. Degrees of freedom for a t-distribution. If omitted but \code{n} is provided, it is inferred as \code{df = n - 1}.}

\item{n}{Integer. Sample size. If \code{df} is missing, \code{df} is inferred as \code{n - 1}. If \code{df} is provided but \code{n} is missing, \code{n = df + 1}.}

\item{p}{Numeric. P-value associated with the test statistic.}

\item{ci}{Numeric vector of length 2. Confidence interval bounds (lower, upper).}

\item{statistic}{Numeric. Test statistic (t or z value), if already known.}

\item{one_sided}{Logical. Whether the hypothesis test is one-sided. Default is \code{FALSE} (two-sided).}

\item{conf.level}{Numeric between 0 and 1. Confidence level for the confidence interval. Default is \code{0.95}.}

\item{digits}{Integer. Number of decimal digits to round the output. Default is \code{3}.}
}
\value{
A named numeric vector containing:
\describe{
\item{Estimate}{Regression coefficient (standardized or unstandardized)}
\item{SE}{Standard error of the coefficient}
\item{t or z}{Test statistic used, depending on \code{df} presence}
\item{df}{Degrees of freedom (if available or inferred), otherwise \code{NA}}
\item{p or p_one}{P-value (one- or two-sided)}
\item{LL}{Lower bound of the confidence interval}
\item{UL}{Upper bound of the confidence interval}
}
}
\description{
\code{backcalc_coeffs()} reconstructs inferential statistics for a regression coefficient.
It allows for partial input of summary or inferential statistics and infers missing values
such as standard errors, test statistics, confidence intervals, p-values, and degrees of freedom.
It supports both unstandardized and standardized coefficients.
}
\details{
The function infers as much as possible based on the inputs provided. It supports inputs including
raw correlations, sample sizes, standard errors, confidence intervals, p-values, test statistics, and degrees of freedom.

The function accepts a flexible combination of inputs. If sufficient information is not provided,
it attempts to approximate missing values where logically possible. Standardized coefficients can be
derived from unstandardized ones using the provided standard deviations. Missing SEs or test statistics
may be inferred from confidence intervals or p-values. If both \code{n} and \code{df} are missing,
a z-distribution is assumed.
}
\examples{
# Unstandardized beta example: coefficient and SE, z-test assumed
backcalc_coeffs(b = 0.5, se = 0.1)

# Standardized beta and conversion example: unstandardized beta and SE with SDs to infer standardized beta
backcalc_coeffs(b = 1.1, se = 0.3, sd_x = 2.5, sd_y = 5)

# Insufficient information example: only p-value provided, no estimate or SE (function returns NULL with warning)
backcalc_coeffs(p = 0.05)
