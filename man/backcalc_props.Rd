\arguments{
\item{prop}{Numeric vector of proportion(s). For one-sample, a single value; for two-sample, a vector of length 2.}

\item{se}{Standard error of the estimate, if known.}

\item{n}{Sample size(s). A single value for one-sample tests, or a vector of length 2 for two-sample tests.}

\item{x}{Count(s) of "successes" (used to compute proportions). A single value or vector of length 2.}

\item{ci}{Confidence interval (numeric vector of length 2: lower and upper limits), if already known.}

\item{p}{P-value for the test statistic. If not provided, it will be computed when possible.}

\item{one_sided}{Logical. Is the test one-sided? Defaults to \code{FALSE} (i.e., two-sided).}

\item{digits}{Number of decimal places to round results. Default is 3.}

\item{interval_type}{Type of confidence interval. Currently unused (placeholder).}

\item{statistic}{Observed test statistic (z or t), if known.}

\item{df}{Degrees of freedom, required if using a t-statistic.}

\item{conf.level}{Confidence level for the confidence interval. Default is 0.95.}

\item{method}{Character. Either \code{"wald"} (default) for normal approximations or \code{"exact"} for exact binomial CI (one-sample only).}

\item{continuity}{Logical. Whether to apply continuity correction in two-sample Wald test. Default is \code{FALSE}.}

\item{attr}{Logical; if TRUE, attaches approximation messages as attributes (default TRUE).}
}
\value{
A \code{data.frame} with the back-calculated statistics including Estimate, SE,
test statistic (t or z), degrees of freedom (df), p-value, and confidence interval bounds.
The output has class \code{"backcalc"} and contains attribute
\code{"Approximations"} if \code{attr = TRUE}.
}
\description{
This function reconstructs inferential statistics related to proportions from partial information.
It can estimate standard errors, confidence intervals, p-values, test statistics (t or z), degrees of freedom,
and point estimates when some components are missing, supporting one-sample, paired, and two-sample cases.
}
\details{
This function is designed to handle partial or minimal inputs by inferring missing values when possible.
For instance, if only a proportion and p-value are provided, it can back-calculate the sample size or test statistic.
}
\examples{
# One-sample: Provide proportion and sample size only (basic one-sample proportion)
backcalc_props(prop = 0.4, n = 100)

# Two-sample: Provide two proportions and sample sizes only (difference in proportions)
backcalc_props(prop = c(0.55, 0.4), n = c(150, 130))

# Insufficient info: Provide n only, no prop, counts, or se
backcalc_props(n = 100)
