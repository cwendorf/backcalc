  prop = NULL,
  se = NULL,
  n = NULL,
  x = NULL,
  ci = NULL,
  p = NULL,

}
\arguments{
\item{prop}{Proportion estimate(s). Can be a single proportion or a vector of two for a two-sample test.}

\item{se}{Standard error. If not provided, it will be computed when possible.}

\item{n}{Sample size(s). Required for SE calculation unless \code{se} or \code{ci} is provided.
For two-sample comparisons, supply a numeric vector of length 2.}

\item{x}{Count(s) of successes. Used with \code{n} to compute proportion.}

\item{ci}{Confidence interval for the proportion (vector of length 2).}

\item{p}{P-value (optional). If not provided, will be computed from the test statistic.}

\item{one_sided}{Logical; if \code{TRUE}, computes one-sided p-value. Default is \code{FALSE} (two-sided).}

\item{digits}{Number of decimal places for rounding output. Default is 3.}

\item{interval_type}{Method used for inference; currently supports \code{"wald"} (default).}

\item{statistic}{Test statistic value (z or t). If not supplied, will be calculated from estimate and SE.}

\item{df}{Degrees of freedom. Required for t-tests. If not provided and \code{n} has length 2, it will be inferred.}

\item{conf.level}{Confidence level used to compute critical value for inference. Default is \code{0.95}.}
}
\value{
A named numeric vector with the following elements:
\describe{
\item{Estimate}{Proportion or difference in proportions}
\item{SE}{Standard error of the estimate}
\item{z or t}{The test statistic used for inference}
\item{df}{Degrees of freedom (NA for z-tests)}
\item{p-one or p}{The one-sided or two-sided p-value}
\item{LL}{Lower bound of the confidence interval}
\item{UL}{Upper bound of the confidence interval}
}
}
\description{
This function performs inference on proportions by back-calculating missing quantities
such as standard error (SE), test statistic, p-value, or confidence intervals (CIs)
from the available inputs. It supports both one-sample and two-sample proportion
comparisons using either z-tests or t-tests, and works with raw counts or precomputed
proportions.
}
\details{
\itemize{
\item When \code{prop} is a two-element vector and \code{n} has two values, a two-sample comparison is assumed.
\item If \code{df} is not provided but \code{n} has length 2, degrees of freedom are approximated as \code{n1 + n2 - 2}.
\item CI bounds are logit-transformed when \code{prop} is between 0 and 1 to maintain valid intervals.
\item Exact methods are not currently implemented.

\examples{
# One-sample: Provide proportion and sample size only (basic one-sample proportion)
backcalc_props(prop = 0.4, n = 100)

# Two-sample: Provide two proportions and sample sizes only (difference in proportions)
backcalc_props(prop = c(0.55, 0.4), n = c(150, 130))

# Insufficient info: No inputs provided (error expected due to missing info)
backcalc_props()
