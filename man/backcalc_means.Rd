\arguments{
\item{m}{Numeric vector of means or mean differences. For two-sample cases, provide
a vector of length 2 representing group means.}

\item{se}{Numeric vector of standard errors corresponding to the means or difference.}

\item{sd}{Numeric vector of standard deviations for each group.}

\item{n}{Numeric vector of sample sizes for each group.}

\item{df}{Degrees of freedom associated with the estimate(s).}

\item{p}{P-value(s) associated with the test statistic.}

\item{ci}{Numeric vector of length 2 specifying a confidence interval (lower and upper bounds).}

\item{statistic}{Test statistic value (e.g., t or z statistic).}

\item{paired}{Logical indicating whether the comparison is paired (default is FALSE).}

\item{one_sided}{Logical indicating whether a one-sided test is used (default is FALSE).}

\item{conf.level}{Confidence level for intervals (default 0.95).}

\item{digits}{Number of digits to round the output statistics (default 3).}

\item{attr}{Logical; if TRUE, attaches approximation messages as attributes (default TRUE).}
}
\value{
A \code{data.frame} with the back-calculated statistics including Estimate, SE,
test statistic (t or z), degrees of freedom (df), p-value, and confidence interval bounds.
The output has class \code{"backcalc"} and contains attribute
\code{"Approximations"} if \code{attr = TRUE}.
}
\description{
This function reconstructs inferential statistics related to means from partial information.
It can estimate standard errors, confidence intervals, p-values, test statistics (t or z), degrees of freedom,
and point estimates when some components are missing, supporting one-sample, paired, and two-sample cases.
}
\details{
The function handles both one- and two-sample cases and calculates missing values using
standard formulas and approximations. It supports pooled and Welch-Satterthwaite
degrees of freedom, approximation of SE from SD and sample size, estimation from CI
width, and estimation of test statistics and p-values. Messages about assumptions
and approximations are stored as attributes.

\examples{
# One-sample example: Mean, SE, and sample size given (uses t-distribution)
backcalc_means(m = 25.4, se = 2.1, n = 30)

# Two-sample example: Means, SDs, and sample sizes given (Welch t-test inference)
backcalc_means(m = c(15, 12), sd = c(4, 5), n = c(40, 35))

# Insufficient input example: Mean provided but no SE, p-value, or CI (warns user)
backcalc_means(m = 25)
