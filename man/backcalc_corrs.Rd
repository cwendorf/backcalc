\usage{
backcalc_corrs(
  r = NULL,
  se = NULL,
  n = NULL,
  df = NULL,
  p = NULL,
  ci = NULL,
  one_sided = FALSE,
  digits = 3,
  statistic = NULL,
  conf.level = 0.95,
  attr = TRUE
)
}
\arguments{
\item{r}{Numeric. Correlation coefficient. For one-sample cases, a single value. For two-sample comparisons, a vector of length 2.}

\item{se}{Numeric. Standard error of the Fisher z-transformed correlation.}

\item{n}{Numeric. Sample size. For two-sample comparisons, provide a vector of length 2. Used to infer \code{se} and \code{df} when missing.}

\item{df}{Numeric. Degrees of freedom (optional). If not provided and \code{n} is available, it will be inferred.}

\item{p}{Numeric. p-value (optional). If not provided, it will be inferred from other inputs.}

\item{ci}{Numeric vector of length 2. Confidence interval for the correlation coefficient (on the raw correlation scale, not Fisher z).}

\item{one_sided}{Logical. Whether the test is one-sided (default is \code{FALSE}). Affects p-value and confidence interval calculation.}

\item{digits}{Integer. Number of significant digits for rounding results (default = \code{3}).}

\item{statistic}{Numeric. Test statistic (usually a t- or z-value). Can be used to infer \code{se} if missing.}

\item{conf.level}{Numeric between 0 and 1. Confidence level for the confidence interval (default is \code{0.95}).}

\item{attr}{Logical; if TRUE, attaches approximation messages as attributes (default TRUE).}
}
\value{
A \code{data.frame} with the back-calculated statistics including Estimate, SE,
test statistic (t or z), degrees of freedom (df), p-value, and confidence interval bounds.
The output has class \code{"backcalc"} and contains attribute
\code{"Approximations"} if \code{attr = TRUE}.
}
\description{
This function reconstructs missing inferential statistics for correlation coefficients
using Fisher's z-transformation. It supports both one-sample and two-sample correlation comparisons
and allows flexible combinations of inputs to infer standard errors, test statistics, p-values,
confidence intervals, and degrees of freedom.
}
\details{
The function uses Fisher's r-to-z transformation (\code{atanh()}) for inferential computations and back-transforms using \code{tanh()}.
If only a subset of values is provided (e.g., only \code{r} and \code{statistic}), the function attempts to infer the rest.

In two-sample cases, the difference between Fisher z-transformed correlations is used as the estimate, and the standard error is derived accordingly.

Informative notes are printed to indicate any approximations or inferred values used during the calculation.

\examples{
# One-sample: r + p-value + df (infer se, CI)
backcalc_corrs(r = 0.52, p = 0.02, df = 18)

# Two-sample: Two correlations + unequal n (infer difference, se, df, p, CI)
backcalc_corrs(r = c(0.70, 0.50), n = c(40, 25))

# Insufficient information: Two correlations but missing sample sizes (error)
backcalc_corrs(r = c(0.3, 0.5))
