\arguments{
\item{F}{Numeric vector of F-statistics.}

\item{df1}{Numeric vector of numerator degrees of freedom.}

\item{df2}{Numeric vector of denominator degrees of freedom.}

\item{p}{Numeric vector of p-values.}

\item{eta2}{Numeric vector of partial eta-squared values.}

\item{f}{Numeric vector of Cohen's f values.}

\item{design}{Character vector: "between", "within", or "mixed".}

\item{n}{Numeric vector: total sample size(s) or vector of group Ns.}

\item{levels}{List: each element is an integer vector of factor levels for the effect.}

\item{subjects}{Numeric vector: number of subjects (for within/mixed designs).}

\item{epsilon}{Numeric vector: sphericity correction factors.}

\item{effect}{Character vector: "main" or "interaction".}

\item{conf.level}{Confidence level for eta-squared CI.}

\item{digits}{Rounding digits for output.}

\item{attr}{Attach approximation notes as attributes.}
}
\value{
A data.frame with one row per effect, containing F, df1, df2, p,
Cohen's f, partial eta-squared, and CI bounds for eta-squared. Attributes store approximation notes.
}
\description{
Handles between-subjects, within-subjects, factorial, and mixed designs, with optional
sphericity corrections. Works with multiple effects at once.
