#' @details
#' `backcalc` is an R package designed to help researchers and students reconstruct key inferential statistics —- 
#' such as standard errors, confidence intervals, test statistics, and p-values —- 
#' from partial or incomplete summary data commonly found in scientific literature. 
#' Supporting various data types and designs, including single- and two-sample (independent or paired) tests 
#' with z or t distributions, it offers tailored functions for means, medians, 
#' correlations, regression coefficients, proportions, and ratio measures.
