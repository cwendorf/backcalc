Each section of examples below progresses from more complete input to
less complete input, moving from miminal required inference to maximal
inference on the part of the function. Similarly, the structure
highlights the flexibility of the function across diverse study designs
and input constraints.

``` r
# 15. Only statistic and df provided (no estimate or SE)
backcalc_means(statistic = 2.5, df = 18)
```

    Insufficient input: Provide estimate and at least one of SE, p-value, CI, or test statistic.
