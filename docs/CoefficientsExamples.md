Each section of examples below progresses from more complete input to
less complete input, moving from miminal required inference to maximal
inference on the part of the function. Similarly, the structure
highlights the flexibility of the function across diverse study designs
and input constraints.

### Insufficient Information Cases

``` r
# 11. Only p-value given, no estimate or SE
backcalc_coeffs(p = 0.05)
```

    Insufficient information: cannot estimate coefficient or SE. 

``` r
# 12. Only SE given, no estimate
backcalc_coeffs(se = 0.15)
```

    Insufficient information: cannot estimate coefficient or SE. 

``` r
# 13. Only confidence interval lower bound (invalid length)
backcalc_coeffs(ci = 0.3)
```

    CI must be a numeric vector of length 2.
    Insufficient information: cannot estimate coefficient or SE. 

``` r
# 14. Only standardized SE given, no standardized beta
backcalc_coeffs(se_std = 0.05)
```

    Insufficient information: cannot estimate coefficient or SE. 

``` r
# 15. Only sample size given, no estimate, SE, or p
backcalc_coeffs(n = 100)
```

    Insufficient information: cannot estimate coefficient or SE.
